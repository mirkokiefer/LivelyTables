#LivelyTables
A crazy, semantic database written in erlang.  
Its a fun attempt to create a semantic modeling backend thats in large parts written in itself.  

There isn't much documentation - only some basics about the [HTTP interface](https://github.com/mirkok/LivelyTables/blob/master/docs/HTTP%20Interface.md).
